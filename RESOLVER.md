# Skill Resolver

**You MUST consult this resolver as the first step of any non-trivial task.** When a task pattern below matches what you're about to do, READ the mapped skill(s) before proceeding. Not after. Not "I know what it says." Read.

This is the enforcement layer for every skill in this collection and the electinfo collection. Skills are only useful if they fire before action.

## THE FIRST GATE: `think`

> **The most important skill in this entire chain is `think`.** Every catalog-bypass, every premature cutover, every half-designed pipeline this resolver exists to prevent traces back to acting before thinking.

Before ANY of the following, you MUST read `skills/thinking/think/SKILL.md` and produce a written design note:

- Implementing a new feature
- Refactoring existing code
- Changing architecture (new layer, new catalog, new data path, new integration)
- Making a cutover (moving Consumer / production traffic to a new source)
- Proposing a schema change
- Building a new skill, hook, or enforcement mechanism (yes, including this resolver itself)
- Any task estimated > 30 minutes

**Explicit exemptions** (from `think` skill): trivial fixes, following step-by-step instructions from the user, research/read-only work, non-code tasks.

The `think` gate is not a pattern-match entry below — it is the **first gate**. Every other pattern in this resolver assumes `think` has already fired.

## How to use

1. **`think` first** if the task has architectural or blast-radius implications (see above).
2. Scan the task patterns below.
3. If any pattern matches, `cat` the mapped SKILL.md and read it in full.
4. If multiple patterns match, read all of them.
5. Only then take the action.
6. If no pattern matches but the action has non-trivial blast radius (data writes, mutations to shared systems, infra changes), consult the **universal checks** at the bottom.

## Universal pre-action checks (always apply)

These fire for every non-trivial action, regardless of whether a pattern above matched:

0. **THINK FIRST** (the non-negotiable gate): for anything beyond a trivial mechanical change, read `skills/thinking/think/SKILL.md` and write a design note. If you can't state what you're about to do, why, what could go wrong, and what the rollback looks like — you are not ready to act. Every serious failure in this session traces back to skipping this.

1. **Catalog-first**: if the action touches data that lives under a catalog (Unity Catalog, Hive Metastore), go through the catalog. Never write raw paths to bucket locations the catalog manages. Confirm the table's registered location BEFORE writing.

2. **Brain-first** (borrowed from GBrain): before calling any external API or running any mutation, check if we have the answer / target already. Re-use before recreating.

3. **Test-before-bulk**: any batch operation (≥20 items) runs on 3–5 items first, verifies, then scales.

4. **Ticket-required**: non-trivial work has a ticket. If you're about to commit, there's a ticket reference in the message.

5. **Branch-correct**: you are on a feature branch, not main / master / develop, for any write.

6. **Dual-mirror check** (for dual-tracked repos electinfo↔gitlab): after acting on one side, mirror to the other.

7. **No-attribution**: never add Claude/AI attribution to commits, PRs, or public-facing content.

8. **Measure twice, cut once**: for destructive or irreversible actions (drops, deletes, force-push, hard-reset), confirm scope first.

---

## What if nothing matches?

If you're doing something truly novel that no skill covers, default to:

1. **Read `skills/thinking/think/SKILL.md`** and write a brief design note.
2. **Confirm with the user** before acting if blast radius is non-trivial.
3. **File a skill-creation task** if this turns out to be a recurring pattern — see `skills/meta/skillbuilder/SKILL.md`.

## Enforcement

This resolver is surfaced into every session via:

- **Session start**: referenced from every project's CLAUDE.md.
- **Every user turn**: injected via `UserPromptSubmit` hook (`hooks/resolver/inject-resolver.sh`) so it stays in active context.
- **Pre-tool-use**: `PreToolUse` hooks on `Bash` match dangerous catalog/data-write patterns and block with a STOP-read-skill reminder (`hooks/infrastructure/catalog-guard.sh`).

Skills collection paths (all relative to their repo roots):

- **Siege (this repo)**: `~/git/electinfo/claude-configs-public/skills/`
- **Electinfo**: `~/git/electinfo/electinfo_claude_skills/skills/` (includes a subtree of siege skills under `skills/siege/` plus electinfo-specific skills at the top level)
